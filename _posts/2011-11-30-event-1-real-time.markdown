Spotify has opened up their API's. This is exciting. But what can we actually do with them? 

Protothon will explore the creative potential of this in a 24 hour event where inter-disciplinary teams of creatives and coders will rapid prototype their asses off to invent the answers. 

#Protothon1 is held at Berghs School of Communication on 21st of January 2012.

The call for designers and programmers is now open.
